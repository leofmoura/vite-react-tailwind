# Vite + React + TailwindCSS

This is a simple example on how to use Vite with React and TailwindCSS.

I've used [Log Rocket Blog Post](https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-dev-environment-react-vite-tailwind/) as a guide.

It's facinating how vite makes bundling and optimization of codebase easy.

It's super simple to use it.
